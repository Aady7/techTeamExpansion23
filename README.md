# Task: Create a Form and Store Data in Firestore

## Description

The task involves creating a form with specific fields and submitting the form. On submission, the data should be stored in a Firestore database. Participants are also required to create a collection with their first name and branch, following a specific naming convention.

## Task Requirements

1. Create a form with the following fields:
   - **Name**: A field for participants to enter their full name.
   - **Branch**: A field for participants to enter their branch of study.
   - **Email**: A field for participants to enter their email address.
   - **PhoneNumber**: A field for participants to enter their phone number.

2. All fields mentioned above are required, meaning participants must provide information for each field before submitting the form.

3. Implement form validation to ensure that participants provide valid data. For example, validate that the email address follows the proper format, and ensure the phone number is in a valid format as well.

4. Design and implement a user interface (UI) for the form. Participants are free to choose any framework they prefer for building the UI.

5. Configure Firebase Firestore to store the form data. You will provide the participants with the Firebase configuration file that they will need to integrate into their solution.

6. Participants should create a collection in Firestore with the following naming convention:
   - Collection Name: FirstNameBranch
   - For example, if a participant's name is "Balveer Singh Rao" and their branch is "Electrical Engineering" the collection name would be "BalveerElectrical".

7. Once participants complete the task, they are required to raise a pull request on this repository.

## Deadline

The deadline for completing this task is the end of the day (EOD) on July 13th.

## Additional Notes

- Participants are free to use any framework of their choice for building the form and UI. They can select from popular options such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or any other framework they are comfortable with.

- We encourage you to write clean and well-documented code. This will make reviewing your submissions easier and allow for better evaluation of your skills.
